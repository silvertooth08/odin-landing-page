# odin-landing-page


in this exercise I will make a landing page by following the instructions on odin project

 This looked like an easy thing to do at a first glance, but soon i realized it is more than just combining the previous exercises and learning about checking the margins and manipulating divs all around the page.

Also the copyright warning scared me a little too I must admit.

NOTE TO SELF: PLEASE PLEASE DON'T ADD GLOBAL PADDING!! JUST ADD IT WHEN NECESSARY!

Excess usage of containers mixs things up horribly as well.

Nesting can get messy.
