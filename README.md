# odin-landing-page


in this exercise I will make a landing page by following the instructions on odin project

 This looked like an easy thing to do at a first glance, but soon i realized it is more than just combining the previous exercises and learning about checking the margins and manipulating divs all around the page.

Also the copyright warning scared me a little too I must admit.

NOTE TO SELF: PLEASE PLEASE DON'T ADD GLOBAL PADDING!! JUST ADD IT WHEN NECESSARY!

Excess usage of containers mixs things up horribly as well.

Nesting can get messy.

Widths and heights make or break the structure as well.

Not sure where to use flex shrink or grow yet but put a feature on buttons anyway.

In this project I tried to benefit column formation on the body so i could ensure footer is in the bottom. Then every section is divided and then padding is added globally on div which was a regretable choice.

After many trials and errors margin and padding issues are fixed.

Image and centerting were kind of a problem to deal with but when I realized which element contains the other and where to put display flex command everything became easier and a lot like the flex exercises.

Still, I believe what I tried to achieve could be done in much less coding probably.
